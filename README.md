# TrickMyMind Staking Program
</div>

## Overview
Contains the Solana staking program for the TrickMyMind app.  Users use the TrickMyMind app to create new habits, and for each habit, have an activity that can be done daily.  With this staking program, users have the ability to put their money where their mouth is, and "bet" on themselves.  This serves as extra incentive to perform the activities needed to create the new habit.  So, users can stake a deposit for 30 days.  For every day that the user performs their habit activity, they earn 1/30th of their deposit.  At the end of 30 days, users can withdraw their **earned** funds.  Any remaining unearned funds are donated directly to TrickMyMind to cover business and development costs.
